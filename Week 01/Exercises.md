# C\# - Week 1

## Exercise 1
Model the complex number as a class in C#. Create constructors for different input parameters. Implement common operations such as addition and subtraction as methods of the class and as overloaded operators. Finally, override ToString() method for informative output.

## Exercise 2
a) A cafeteria serves coffee in three variations; Small size is 100 ml, normal is 150 ml and double is 300 ml. Implement the class Coffee. Use Enumerations for the different sizes. Create a sample coffee and print its characteristic. For example, `Normal coffee is 150 ml.`
b) Create a class Order which implements a method CalculateCost which takes as input an array of coffee order items and returns the total price of the order. The price of the coffee is  based on its size. Small costs 0.50 euro, normal 1.5 and double 2.50

## Exercise 3
Create a static class "Utilities" and implement a method which takes two integers parameters and swaps them. Use ref. Create a second method which swaps generic types.

## Exercise 4
Initialize an array of 10 students and sort them by mark in ascending order. Use the interface `System.IComparable<T>`

## Exercise 5
Implement the following classes: Dog, Cat, Lion. All of them are animals (Animal). Animals are characterized by age, name and gender. Each animal makes a sound (use a virtual method in the Animal class). Create an array of different animals and print on the console their name, age and the corresponding sound each one makes.
