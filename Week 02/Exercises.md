# C\# - Week 2

## Exercise 01
1. Define a class which holds information about a mobile device: model, manufacturer, base price, features of battery (battery type and capacity) and features of the screen (resolution and pixel density). You have to decide how many classes and which data types to use.
2. Declare several constructors for each of the classes which have different lists of parameters.
3. Add 3-4 static fields which hold information about known models, for example Asus Zenfone 2, iPhone 7 etc.
4. Add a class Usage which holds information about the usage of the mobile device. This includes current percentage of battery,  OS information and call history. Each call record saves information about the date, time of start and time of end of the call and if it was incoming or outcoming. Provide useful properties like duration of the call.
